## Cookies (for private or age-gated content)

You can provide cookies to `yt-dlp` so it can access private or age-gated videos.

- `AOI_COOKIEFILE`: Path to a Netscape-format cookie file mounted in the container or present on disk.
- `AOI_COOKIES_BASE64`: Base64-encoded Netscape cookie file. If set (and `AOI_COOKIEFILE` is not set), the server will write it to `server/.cookies.txt` at startup and use it automatically.

Example (Docker):

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e AOI_COOKIES_BASE64="$(base64 -w0 cookies.txt)" \
  all-in-one-downloader
```

Notes:
- Use cookies only from accounts you own. Keep them secret; anyone with the cookie can act as your account.
- Rotate/regenerate cookies periodically; services expire them.
